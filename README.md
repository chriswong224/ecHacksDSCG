# Geld

Geld is a financing app that'll help you and your family make the best of your budgeting with incentives such as points and goals. Also with the sleek and easy to use ui, you will never have to fuss again about managing money for the whole family.

# The Whole Story



## Inspiration
We wanted to create something that was practical and had something to do with money, and so we wanted so create some kind of budgeting app. We thought about why budgeting and saving was difficult for people, and we arrived at the conclusion that it was often difficult to see the results of saving in the short term, and the reward system in Geld is a way around that.

## What it does


## How we built it
The Geld front end was developed through php, CSS, HTML, Angular, and js. The bootstrap framework was used to make our website responsive and javascript was used to create the login and sign up portal. In addition many of the graphs and charts in the web 
application were created through js and the angular framework. While we did include php in our project, we did not end up using almost any of it's features as our backend developer used mongo db. 

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we ran into were issues involving our intial setup of the ui using only angular and raw CSS, and everything looked absoultely terrible. As a result we switched over to bootstrap to style our front-end. Part way through the project, we realized certain features were impossible without data from the bank, and as a result we had to fill the data base with dummy data. Furthermore, the project was really challenginng as a result of everyone having different skills.  

## Accomplishments we're proud of
We were sucessfully able to create a good looking front end and get the database to communicate with it, which was a first for many members on our team, as we mainly work on front end projects. 

## What we learnt
We learned how difficult creating a backend for a website and we learned the usefulness of using frameworks for various aspects of our project. 

## What's next for Geld
We hope to refine our back end as we consider it kind rough in its current stage. In terms of the business we hope to form some partnerships with the company and even the government to help implement some rewards.
